The main difference between executing SQL queries using Python and executing them in MySQL Workbench lies in the environment and the way the queries are executed:

Environment:
MySQL Workbench: MySQL Workbench provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with MySQL databases. It allows users to write and execute SQL queries, manage database connections, visualize database structures, and perform various database administration tasks.
Python: When executing SQL queries using Python, you typically use a database library such as mysql-connector-python, pymysql, or SQLAlchemy to connect to a database from within a Python script or application. Python provides a programming environment where you can integrate SQL queries into your code alongside other logic and functionality.

Interactivity:
MySQL Workbench: MySQL Workbench provides a visual environment where you can write and execute SQL queries interactively. You can see the results directly within the application, and you can easily edit and rerun queries as needed.
Python: When executing SQL queries using Python, you typically write SQL statements as strings within your Python code. You can execute these queries programmatically using database library functions. The results are often retrieved as data structures within your Python code, such as lists or dictionaries, which you can then manipulate and process further.

Integration:
MySQL Workbench: While MySQL Workbench is primarily focused on interacting with MySQL databases, it provides various features for database management, development, and visualization. However, it may not be as tightly integrated with other parts of your application or workflow.
Python: Integrating SQL queries within Python allows you to seamlessly incorporate database operations into your broader application logic. This can be useful for building applications, automating tasks, performing data analysis, or generating reports where SQL queries are just one part of the overall functionality.
In summary, MySQL Workbench provides a standalone environment for interactive SQL query execution and database management, while executing SQL queries using Python allows for tighter integration within Python applications and workflows, enabling more complex and flexible interactions with databases.
